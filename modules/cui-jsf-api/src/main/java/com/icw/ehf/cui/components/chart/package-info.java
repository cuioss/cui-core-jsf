 * The defined object structure represent the jqPlot JavaScript API.
 * This allow to configure needed Graph dynamic,
 * because the whole graph model could be defined on runtime if needed.
 * In this way the full jqPlot JavaScript API could be used without a need of static graph
 * configuration or error-prone manual build of JSON objects.
 * The model is based on {@link com.icw.ehf.cui.components.js} defined classes which already provide
 * a easy way for JSON transformation.
